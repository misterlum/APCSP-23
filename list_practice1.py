'''
Some more exercises to complete using lists in Python.

Note that most of them use some sort of loop to iterate across a list,
so most likely, you will use the for loop to do so
'''

'''
Exercise 0 (example)

Find the sum of a list
'''
print("Exercise 0")
#list is defined below here
list0 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]

print("Your total is")
#implement your code below here
total = 0

for x in list0:
    total = total + x

#check your answer below here
print(total)
print("The total is supposed to be 36\n")



'''
Exercise 1

Find the mean average of a list
'''
print("Exercise 1")
#list is defined below here
list1 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]

print("Your mean is")
#implement your code below here



#check your answer below here
print("The mean is supposed to be 7.0\n")




'''
Exercise 2

Print even numbers from a list
'''
print("Exercise 2")
#list is defined below here
list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

print("Your printout is")
#implement your code below here



#check your answer below here
print("The printout should be \n2\n4\n6\n8\n\10\n")



'''
Exercise 3

Print odd numbers from a list
'''
print("Exercise 3")
#list is defined below here
list3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

print("Your printout is")
#implement your code below here



#check your answer below here
print("The printout should be \n1\n3\n5\n7\n9\n")



'''
Exercise 4

Count how many even numbers there are in a list
'''
print("Exercise 4")
#list is defined below here
list4 = [11, 22, 33, 44, 66, 77, 1010]

print("Your count is")
#implement your code below here



#check your answer below here
print("There are 4 even numbers\n")



'''
Exercise 5

Count how many positive numbers there are in a list,
and count how many negative numbers there are.
'''
print("Exercise 5")
#list is defined below here
list5 = [2, 85, -49, 91, 4, -96, 77]

print("Your count is")
#implement your code below here



#check your answer below here
print("There are 5 positive numbers")
print("There are 2 negative numbers\n")



'''
Exercise 6

Print all words starting with the letter 'a'
'''
print("Exercise 6")
#list is defined below here
list6 = ['apple', 'banana', 'avocado', 'april', 'zebra', 'motor']

print("Your a words")
#implement your code below here



#check your answer below
print("The a words are \napple\navocado\napril\n")

'''
Exercise 7

Print all words starting with a vowel
'''
print("Exercise 7")
#list is defined below here
list7 = ['apple', 'egg', 'milk', 'bread', 'ice cream']

print("Your words that start with a vowel are")
#implement your code below here



#check your answer below here
print("The words that start with a vowel are \napple\negg\nice cream\n")
